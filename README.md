I have successfully set up Firebase Authentication in my project.

🔐 Enabled both Email/Password and Google Sign-in authentication methods from the Firebase console.

👥 Registered two users for testing:

One with Email/Password

One with Google OAuth

📅 Both users were created and logged in on July 28, 2025, confirming the setup is working correctly.

📊 Verified user details and providers under the Authentication > Users section of Firebase.

⚙️ Enabled providers are visible under Authentication > Sign-in method, confirming both are active and functional.

This confirms that the login flow, provider setup, and user authentication are all working as expected.
