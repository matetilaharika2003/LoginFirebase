# 🔐 Firebase Authentication Project

A simple authentication setup using **Firebase** that supports **Email/Password** and **Google Sign-In** methods.

## 🚀 Features

- Sign up and login using **Email & Password**
- Login with **Google Sign-In** using OAuth 2.0
- Firebase Authentication dashboard for managing users
- Realtime user registration and login tracking

## ✅ Summary

I have successfully set up **Firebase Authentication** in this project.

- 🔐 Enabled both **Email/Password** and **Google Sign-in** authentication methods using Firebase.
- 👥 Registered two users for testing:
  - One using **Email/Password**
  - One using **Google OAuth**
- 📅 Both users were created and logged in on **July 28, 2025**, confirming successful login attempts.
- 📊 Verified user entries under **Authentication > Users** in the Firebase Console.
- ⚙️ Confirmed that both sign-in providers are **Enabled** in **Authentication > Sign-in method**.

This confirms the authentication setup is working as expected.
